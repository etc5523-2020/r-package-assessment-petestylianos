covidExplorer contains a Shiny app with summaries, analytics and news related to COVID-19. Download the package and launch the Shiny app to interactively browse data and news regarding the spread of COVID-19 in various countries. The app also enables the user to scrape data from Twitter.
Refer to section [Twitter Tab](#tweet) for more info.



## Installation

You can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-petestylianos")
```
## Example

To launch the app:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(covidExplorer)
covidExplorer::launch_app()
```

This is how the app looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/img.gif")
```


## Twitter Tab {#tweet}

To be able to search Twitter on your RSudio you need to be able to run the following commands: 

api_key <- 'YOUR API KEY' 

api_secret <- 'YOUR API SECRET' 

access_token <- 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN' 

access_token_secret <- 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET' 

setup_twitter_oauth(api_key,api_secret) 

To obtain this tokens and keys you need to log in to Twitter with your account, or create one if necessary. Then you need to setup an application: click on “My Applications” and then click on “Create new application”. 
Almost thre, fill in the blank boxes and a new screen will appear with your private keys and token. 
The final step is to install twitteR from GitHub using the devtools package and run the first 5 commands at the beginning of the section.
