## Twitter Tab {#tweet}

To be able to search Twitter on your RSudio you need to be able to run the following commands: 

api_key <- 'YOUR API KEY' 

api_secret <- 'YOUR API SECRET' 

access_token <- 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN' 

access_token_secret <- 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET' 

setup_twitter_oauth(api_key,api_secret) 

To obtain this tokens and keys you need to log in to Twitter with your account, or create one if necessary. Then you need to setup an application: click on “My Applications” and then click on “Create new application”. 
Almost thre, fill in the blank boxes and a new screen will appear with your private keys and token. 
The final step is to install twitteR from GitHub using the devtools package and run the first 5 commands at the beginning of the section.
